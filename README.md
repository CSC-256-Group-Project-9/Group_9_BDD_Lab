# Group 9 BDD Lab
A resource to guide students towards successfully completing the Behaviour driven development lab (BDD).
## Getting Started:
- A quick review of understanding [BDD, Gherkin, and Behave with a simple to follow example](Understanding_TDD_&_BDD.docx)
- Another great resource for understanding [BDD:](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Gherkins:](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/)
## Project Overview
-  The purpose of this project is to understand and use BDD.
- This repo shows a real-world example of using BDD to solve the mini projects that were issued in the Selenium lab such as using a radio button.
## Installation Guidelines:
- In order to use BDD in a **Python** coding environment
- you just need to:
`pip install behave`
- Remember-- Behave allows you to use the Gherkin file(s) you created and then execute it using python!
 - If that **(`pip install behave`)** doesn't work then try this [resource.](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).
## Understanding This Repo:
- The [features file](https://github.com/CSC-256-Group-Project-9/Group_9_BDD_Lab/tree/main/Features) shows you all examples of BDD within the Selenium Lab.
>- This is how you use Gherkin language to write scenarios for specific features of your code.
- The [steps file](https://github.com/CSC-256-Group-Project-9/Group_9_BDD_Lab/tree/main/Features/steps) shows you how behave executes the BDD examples
>- This is how you would implement Behave to execute the Gherkin language using Python.
* Remember the **BDD approach is being used to test the functionalities** of the mini-projects in the Selenium lab*
